I'm a second-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at <a  href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>, where I am advised by <a  href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/">Thorsten Joachims</a> and <a  href="https://wensun.github.io/">Wen Sun</a>. My research includes reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. My work has been published at NeurIPS, CVPR, WWW, SIGIR, RecSys, and INFOCOM.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at <a  href="https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>, where I had the privilege of working with <a  href="https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/">Baochun Li</a>, <a  href="https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/">Scott Sanner</a>, and <a  href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mvolkovs/">Maksims Volkovs</a>.

I am also a part-time content creator with more than 50,000 followers and 10 million views on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/537049440), [Douyin](https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAAmk2iWqbZmPZZfGJBKYwdhxciN6D24MsoaagyrSWbK6eQxObsfmIFFINyM3RLqnOc), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/gitbag).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
